This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Run

For server running, you should go to `/api` folder.

```npm install```
(If there is no node_modules.)

```npm start```

The server will listen `localhost:4000` and the api will be hosted on `localhost:4000/api`.
There are 2 routes in api.

```
/api/configuration (GET)
/api/dataset (POST)
```

For react app running, you should go to `/`.

```npm install```
(If there is no node_modules.)
```npm start```

PS: you should install `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin` chrome extention to avoid CORS error.
